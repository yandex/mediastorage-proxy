##upload 
###Description
To upload a data send POST to:
```
hostname:port/upload-$namespace/$filename
```
Where are: 
* *$namespace* - storage namespace,
* *$filename* -  name of the key for your data.

When you specify the namespace will be issued Authorization header, which should not forget to indicate -
[more here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).

The proxy has no restrictions on the size of upload files (it uploads by pieces, as they come to the socket).

–ê data should be transmitted as the request body and options should be set as query list arguments.
###HTTP response codes
Handle responses with 200, 400, 401, 507 and 5xx error codes. Detailed description you can find in ["HTTP status code"](#http-status-codes) topic. 

###Example
Request: 
```
curl -H "Authorization: <token>" "http://host.example.com:12000/upload-default/file1" -d "data"
```
Answer:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<post obj="default.file1" id="81d8ba78474fa835aab93150230020bf94d23fc7e4c5390f6f65951210d1f254dad1a27643bd84f087ed39125b1f54a988e5b7e2f5f2d18b0218c00666dd35d1" groups="3" size="4" key="221/file1">
<complete addr="198.51.100.55:1032" path="/srv/storage/8/data-0.0" group="223" status="0"/>
<complete addr="198.51.100.116:1032" path="/srv/storage/8/data-0.0" group="221" status="0"/>
<complete addr="198.51.100.119:1029" path="/srv/storage/5/data-0.0" group="225" status="0"/>
<written>3</written>
</post>
```
Should pay attention to:

| Tag | Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| post | key="221/file1" | The key with which you can work with written data (read and delete). |
| post | obj | Generated key for the data $namespace.$filename). |
| post | id | Sha512(obj) - elliptics saved a data under this key. |
| post | groups | A number of groups in which have tried to write. |
| post | size | A data size. |
| complete | addr | An address of the node where the data were written. |
| complete | path | A path to the data. |
| complete | group | A group number (can be used as part of the key to read/delete operations). |
| complete | status | A status of the operation (0 - ok). |
| written |  | A number of groups that succeeded to write.|

##get
###Description 
To read a data send GET to:
```
hostname:port/get-$namespace/$group/$filename

Where is *$group/$filename* a value from `key` attribute `post` tag in answer from write operation. 

Parameters of request (transmitted by GET):
* `offset` - an offset with which data should be reading;
* `size` - a size of the data chunk to be read;
* `embed` and `embed_timestamp` - flag is used to indicate that the data was written with the meta-information (now is a legacy -  proxy may determine this fact for all new written data).

400 - the request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax, <br/>
401 - forgot to specify a title for the authorization, <br/>
404 - no data was found for this key, <br/>
